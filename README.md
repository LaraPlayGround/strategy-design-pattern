# LaraStack - Strategy Design Pattern
Welcome to LaraStack, your ultimate destination for mastering software design patterns! In this topic, we will explore the Strategy Design Pattern, a powerful behavioral pattern that allows dynamic algorithm selection and promotes flexibility in your applications.

## What is the Strategy Design Pattern?
The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It enables clients to choose the algorithm that best suits their needs at runtime.
